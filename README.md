# Multiple targets tracking
<h4> This algorithm uses a flock of trackers to track a group of targets.
The algorithm is developed using the techniques described in the book: THE NATURE OF CODE
by DANIEL SHIFFMAN ( http://natureofcode.com/book/ ).
It takes into account three cases: <br/>
1. Where the number of trackers is more than the number of targets, 
<br/>2. When the targets and the tracking devices are equal and 
<br/>3. Also when the number of tracking devices are less as compared to the number of targets<br/>
The code runs in processing  ( https://processing.org/download/ ) and is written in JAVA.
Again, check out these amazing toturials at http://natureofcode.com/book/ , without which this project would not have been possible.</h4>
